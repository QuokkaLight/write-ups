# Web70 - The Secret Store

## Description

We all love secrets. Without them, our lives would be dull. A student wrote a secure secret store, however he was babbling about problems with the database. Maybe I shouldn't use the 'admin' account. Hint1: Account deletion is intentional. Hint2: I can't handle long usernames.

## Solution

This challenge was a bit buggy. I didn't really know what we were supposed to do since I flagged it with a simple `admin/admin` user/password couple.

But according to the flag, `IW{TRUNCATION_IS_MY_FRIEND}`, it had something to do with truncation.

Anyway, +70 free puntos (that we didn't deserve).
