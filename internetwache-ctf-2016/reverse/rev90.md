# Rev90 - The Cube

## Description

I really like Rubik's Cubes, so I created a challenge for you. I put the flag on the white tiles and scrambled the cube. Once you solved the cube, you'll know my secret.

## Solution

Another fun challenge. Personally, I took my rubik's cube, did the scrambling, put little stickers on it with the letters and put it back to its original state to get the flag.
