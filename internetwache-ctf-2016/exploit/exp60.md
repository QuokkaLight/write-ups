# Exp60 - EquationSolver

## Description

I created a program for an unsolveable equation system. My friend somehow forced it to solve the equations. Can you tell me how he did it?

## Solution

We are given an unsolveable equation system.

```
X > 1337
X * 7 + 4 = 1337
```

If we take `X = (4294967295-4)/7 ~= 613566756` our `X` turns into a 0. There's an integer overflow vulnerability that we can exploit.

To solve the challenge, we only need to enter `X = (4294967295+1337-4)/7 ~= 613566947`.
